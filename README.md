# Keras-Intro
• Utilized a Keras dataset of clothing images from the  National Institute of Standards and Technology to train the model on.  
• Created a Keras model with a Flatten layer and two Dense layers.
• Trained the model and added a softmax layer to use alongside the test images and predict the top three most likely class labels for the image at its given index.
